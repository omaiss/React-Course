This branch covers the **React Essentials** module of the course. Below is a summary of key concepts and skills learned throughout this section:

## ðŸš€ What I Learned

1. **React is a component-based library** â€“ Everything is built using reusable components.
2. **Creating and using components** â€“ Learned how to define components and use them within JSX.
3. **Component naming conventions** â€“ Component names must start with a capital letter and return renderable content.
4. **Embedding components in JSX** â€“ React components can be used just like HTML elements in JSX.
5. **Understanding props** â€“ Props (properties) are used to pass data and functions to components.
6. **Using props effectively** â€“ Explored various ways to use props, including object destructuring and `props.<name>` syntax.
7. **Dynamic content rendering** â€“ Used curly braces `{}` in JSX to embed JavaScript expressions and display dynamic content.
8. **Children prop** â€“ Discovered the special `children` prop that gives access to nested content between component tags.
9. **Event handling** â€“ Implemented event listeners to create interactive elements (e.g., `onClick`, `onChange`).
10. **Passing functions as props** â€“ Enabled components to handle events using functions passed via props.
11. **Using `useState()` for dynamic UI updates** â€“ Learned how to manage component state and trigger re-renders.
12. **Managing and updating state** â€“ Explored how `useState` allows local state storage and UI responsiveness.
13. **Conditional rendering** â€“ Used ternary operators and logical `&&` to conditionally display content.
14. **Array rendering with `map()`** â€“ Leveraged `.map()` to render dynamic lists of elements from arrays.
15. **A strong foundation in React Essentials** â€“ Gained confidence in building basic React apps with dynamic, reusable, and interactive components.
